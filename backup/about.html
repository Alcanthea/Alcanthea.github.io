          Some years ago, a mere hop skip and a jump of 28 years, I found a long-term passion and pest in drawing. Taking those handful of years to practice, critique, and railing against what opposition I had in my lack of confidence, I learned more and more of the techniques that best suited me. There was a pressure to succeed and always perform. Though as the years went on, that pressure went from constricting to a learning experience. Today I take my classes and occasionally fulfill commissions because the practice I amounted managed to create something that appealed to others. And I couldn't be happier.
